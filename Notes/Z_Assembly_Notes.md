### Registers:

We will often refer to the general registers using a short notation: we sometimes write “GRn”
(meaning the rightmost 32 bits of a 64-bit register) or “GGn” (meaning all 64 bits) or simply
“Rn” to refer to general register n when the register length is clear from context. Thus, in
Figure 10, we might use R1 to mean register 1, R14 to mean register 14, and so on.
Be Careful!

“R1” (without a subscript) is not the same as the notation “R 1 ” (with a
subscript). This difference will be important when we discuss machine
instructions.
